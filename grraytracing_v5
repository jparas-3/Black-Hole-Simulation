# The geodesic equations would be loaded here, you need to convert them to a Python function
# Assuming geodesics is a list of equations you've loaded and want to solve using scipy's solve_ivp
# You will need to convert your 'geodesics_lagrange_Schwarz.mat' MATLAB data to a compatible Python format

# You would define the function that represents your system of ODEs here
def geoFunc(t, Y):
    # Your equations here, replaced with a dummy example
    # dydt = [equation1, equation2, equation3, equation4]
    # return dydt
    pass  # Replace pass with your actual code

# Drawing the screen
# Image loading and processing code would go here

# Solving the ODE for each pixel, this will be done inside a loop or using vectorized operations

# Converting spherical coordinates to Cartesian, these functions would need to be defined in Python

# Displaying the resulting image
